# Chatbot

This project is called FriendBot and is implemented with the help of Chatterbot library. Install requirements.txt to get the right dependencies.

!! IMPORTANT !!

Although ChatterBot 1.2.0 has been released we found many issues with the dependencies, hence we used a lower version --> 1.0.5 instead. All the libraries are installed according to the version of the Chatterbot library we are using. Bumping up the version may cause problems.
