I don't feel good
Why?

You should be postive
Nobody loves me
I don't think so
I have dealing with a lot of pressure and no one wants to help me
Have you talked to your parents?
I don't think i want to
Have you seen a therapist?
No, I haven't
Why not?
Becuase nobody actually cares
Well it doesn't matter. Don't forget that you are very important, you have talents and I am sure that you will find someone who values ​​you.
